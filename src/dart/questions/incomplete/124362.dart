/*
Challenge:
Your task is to write as many programs / functions / snippets as you can, where each one outputs / prints / returns an integer. The first program must output the integer 1, the second one 2 and so on.

You can not reuse any characters between the programs. So, if the first program is: x==x, then you may not use the characters x and = again in any of the other programs. Note: It's allowed to use the same character many times in one program.

Scoring:
The winner will be the submission that counts the highest. In case there's a tie, the winner will be the submission that used the fewest number of bytes in total.

Rules:
You can only use a single language for all integers
Snippets are allowed!
To keep it fair, all characters must be encoded using a single byte in the language you choose.
The output must be in decimal. You may not output it with scientific notation or some other alternative format. Outputting floats is OK, as long as all digits that are shown behind the decimal point are 0. So, 4.000 is accepted. Inaccuracies due to FPA is accepted, as long as it's not shown in the output.
ans =, leading and trailing spaces and newlines etc. are allowed.
You may disregard STDERR, as long as the correct output is returned to STDOUT
You may choose to output the integer to STDERR, but only if STDOUT is empty.
Symbol independent languages (such as Lenguage) are disallowed
Letters are case sensitive a != A.
The programs must be independent
Whitespace can't be reused
You must use ASCII-digits in the output
Explanations are encouraged!
