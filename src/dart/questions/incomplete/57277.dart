Introduction
Last year was my birthday (really!) and sadly I had to organise my own party. Well, now you know, couldn't you at least make the cake?

Challenge
Given an integer n as input, write a full program to output a birthday cake with n candles on.

Output
A piece of cake with one candle on is:

 $
 |
---
~~~
---
And a piece of cake with three candles on is:

 $ $ $
 | | |
-------
~~~~~~~
-------
I'm sure you can work it out from that

However, for input 0, you must output the following:

Congratulations on your new baby! :D
For input less than 0, you should output a candleless cake:

---
~~~
---
Nothing is allowed to be output to STDERR.

Trailing newlines and spaces are allowed.

Winning
Shortest code in bytes wins.
